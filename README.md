## Features  

### • Convert Audio  
Select one or more video or audio files. Press **NVDA+X** and select "Convert Audio" to open the settings window. The system will automatically calculate the file duration. You can customize the audio quality before converting. The tool includes a queueing system to process files one by one, which prevents heavy CPU and RAM usage.  

### • Convert MP3 to MP4  
Select an MP3 file, press **NVDA+X**, and open the "Convert MP3 to MP4" mode. The settings window will appear, allowing you to select one or more images to create a slideshow. You can set the loop duration for each image in seconds. If you don't want to use images, you can also choose a background color instead.  

### • Merge MP3  
Select all the files or a folder containing audio files, press **NVDA+X**, and select "Merge Audio Files." This will open a window where you can reorder the files as you wish, adjust the audio quality, and quickly merge them.  

You can choose between two merge options:  
• Normal merge – files are joined end to end.  
• Cross-fade merge – uses a cross-fade feature so the songs play seamlessly with no gap between tracks.  

### • Trim Audio/Video File  
Select the file you want to trim, press **NVDA+X**, and choose "Trim Audio/Video File." This will open a window to set the desired start and end points. The system will automatically calculate the total file length and display it in the end time field. You can choose to convert the output to MP3 or WAV and specify the audio quality. A "Preview" button is also available to check the start point.
