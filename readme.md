## Features

### Convert Audio
Select one or more video or audio files. Press **NVDA+X** and select "Convert Audio" to open the settings window. The system will automatically calculate the file duration. You can customize the audio quality before converting. The tool includes a queueing system to process files one by one, which prevents heavy CPU and RAM usage.

### Convert MP3 to MP4
Select an MP3 file, press **NVDA+X**, and open the "Convert MP3 to MP4" mode. The settings window will appear, allowing you to select one or more images to create a slideshow. You can set the loop duration for each image in seconds. If you don't want to use images, you can also choose a background color instead.

### Convert Video
Select the video file you want to convert, then press **NVDA+X** to open the context menu.
Choose Convert Video, and the conversion window will open.

### Merge MP3
Select all the files or a folder containing audio files, press **NVDA+X**, and select "Merge Audio Files." This will open a window where you can reorder the files as you wish, adjust the audio quality, and quickly merge them.

You can choose between two merge options:
* Normal merge – files are joined end to end.
* Cross-fade merge – uses a cross-fade feature so the songs play seamlessly with no gap between tracks.

### Record
The first step is to configure the recording format in the Record Settings. After that, you will be able to automatically record audio from anywhere while you work.

### Split Audio
Select the audio file you want to split, then press **NVDA+X** and choose Split Audio to open the configuration window.
Set the number of split points you need, and then specify the end time for each track you want to split.

### Trim Audio/Video File
Select the file you want to trim, press **NVDA+X**, and choose "Trim Audio/Video File." This will open a window to set the desired start and end points. The system will automatically calculate the total file length and display it in the end time field. You can choose to convert the output to MP3 or WAV and specify the audio quality. A "Preview" button is also available to check the start point.
